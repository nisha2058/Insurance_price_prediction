# Insurance_price_prediction
This file is the preection of the insurance price for the given dataframe in insurance.csv.
The model is trained for Linear Regression(LR),
                         SVR()
                         Gradient Boosting Regressor()
                         Random Forest Regressor()
However, the dataframe gave least error for Gradient Boosting Regressor after evaluation from metrices imported from sklearn which are 
# r2_score
# mean_absolute_error
# mean_square_error

model is saved using joblib for Gradient Boosting Regressor().
and the GUI is created using tkinter.
